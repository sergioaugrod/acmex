Acmex is an Elixir Client for the Lets Encrypt [ACMEv2](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme) protocol.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `acmex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:acmex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Configure

Set the `directory_url` in your `config.exs`:

```elixir
config :acmex,
  directory_url: "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
```

If you need a staging version of `Lets Encrypt ACMEv2` set the `directory_url` as https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory.

## Usage

### Client

#### Starting the client

You need to generate a private key to start the client. Acmex actually expects a RSA Key.
If you don't have it, you can create one through Acmex:

```elixir
key = Acmex.OpenSSL.generate_key(:rsa)
```

And now start the client with the generated key:

```elixir
Acmex.start_link(key: key)
```

To use on your supervisor:

```elixir
children = [
  {Acmex, [[key: "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----..."]]}
]
```

### Account

#### Creating a new account

The second parameter is about the agreement of the terms of service.

```elixir
Acmex.new_account(["mailto:info@example.com"], true)
```

#### Fetch existing account

```elixir
Acmex.get_account()
```

### Order

#### Creating a new order

```elixir
Acmex.new_order(["example.com"])
```

#### Fetch an existing order

```elixir
Acmex.get_order(order.url)
```

### Challenge

#### Receive a challenge

```elixir
authorization = List.first(order.authorizations)
challenge = Acmex.Resource.Authorization.http(authorization)
```

#### Return a challenge response

```elixir
Acmex.get_challenge_response(challenge)
```

#### Validate the challenge

```elixir
{:ok, challenge} = Acmex.validate_challenge(challenge)
```

#### Fetch an existing challenge

```elixir
Acmex.get_challenge(challenge.url)
```

### Certificate

#### Finalize an order

```elixir
order_key = Acmex.OpenSSL.generate_key(:rsa)
{:ok, csr} = Acmex.OpenSSL.generate_csr(order_key, ["example.com"])
{:ok, order} = Acmex.finalize_order(order, csr)
```

#### Get the certificate

```elixir
Acmex.get_certificate(order)
```

#### Revoke a certificate

```elixir
{:ok, certificate} = Acmex.get_certificate(order)
Acmex.revoke_certificate(certificate, 0)
```

## Documentation

The full documentation can be found at https://hexdocs.pm/acmex.

## Contributing

To run the tests you need an `ACME Test Server`. You can use [Pebble](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble).
For this reason, there is a `docker-compose.yml` file with `pebble` defined as a service.

To use `pebble` and run the tests:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
$ mix test
```
